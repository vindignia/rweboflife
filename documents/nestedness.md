# Nestedness 


An adjaceincy/incidence matrix representing a network is said to be nested when the non-zero elements in a given row are a subset of the non-zero elements in another row. An example of a perfectly netsed matrix is a square matrix with the upper triangle consists of non-zero elements (say 1s) and the lower triangle consists of zeros. Several possible measurements of the nestedness network are defined in the literature.  I this repository we adopt the definiton given in the manuscript Fortuna, M.A., et al.: Coevolutionary dynamics shape the structure of bacteria‚Äêphage infection networks [Evolution 1001-1011 (2019)] (https://doi.org/10.1111/evo.13731).
