# Null models


### Curveball algorithm 

The curveball  algorithm is described in the manuscript *A fast and unbiased procedure to randomize ecological binary matrices with fixed row and column totals*. Strona, G., et al., [Nature Commun. **5**, 4114 (2014)](https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms5114).  
The function that can be invoked with the command 

> null_model(Mat, iter_max = 200, model = "curveball")
  
where `Mat` is for the original matrix to be randomized, is adapted from the code provided by the authors along with their manuscript.
